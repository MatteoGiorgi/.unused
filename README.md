# unused dotfiles

Nothing fancy, some config files of programs I haven't used in a while (still
perfectly working thow).

* **Emacs**. I certenly do not have to explain [why](http://www.textfiles.com/programming/vivsemacs.txt) you should use Vim instead.
* **Kitty**. It is a very cute terminal emulator and full of feature too but I have
  encontered some issues with my custom font set.
* **Nvim**. No way, I'll sick with *Vim* for now (it feels more hardcore).
* **Rofi**. It is cool, isn't it? But I prefer to specify its configs in the
  *Xresources* or using the command line options.
* **Vieb**. I like it but it's not mature enough (I'm using it once in a while
  though)
* **Vifm**. A very solid file manager but not my cup of tea, I won't leave
  *ranger* and *fff* for it, they're my perfect combo.
* **Xorg**. Here there are my old *Xresources* with the *URxvt* configs: I'm
  using other terminal emulator in [these days](https://github.com/MatteoGiorgi/.dotfiles).
